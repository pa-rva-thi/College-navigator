The Campus Navigation System is a web-based application designed to help students, faculty, and visitors easily navigate the college campus. The system provides an interactive map interface that displays academic blocks, laboratories, departments, sports facilities, and other important locations within the campus.

Users can search for a specific department or facility, view its location on the map, and get directions from their current position. The system also supports floor-wise navigation inside the Main Block, allowing users to locate departments such as EEE (Ground Floor), CSE & Robotics (First Floor), and ECE (Third Floor).

The application is built using modern web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Leaflet.js for map integration. It features a user-friendly interface, real-time location tracking using the Geolocation API, and dynamic route visualization.

This project aims to simplify campus navigation, reduce confusion for new students and visitors, and provide a smart digital solution for institutional infrastructure mapping.
